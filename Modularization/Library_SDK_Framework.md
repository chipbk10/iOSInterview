# Library & SDK & Framework

## Library

- A library is a chunk of code that performs a certain function or a set of related functions

## SDK

- SDK has a wider scope than libraries do. SDK is a collection of libraries, API, documentation, utilities, sample code that helps us implement certain feature without having to do the work from the scratch.

## Framework

- Framework gives us a foundation on top of that we can build our app. SDK might help us make a building block, but a framework will help us to build an entire app that is made of multiple blocks.
- We can imagine like a library is a stove, SDK is a kitchen, and Framework is a house

## Static vs Dynamic Framework

- Static Library will be converted into the one file and added into the main codebase, and then will be compiled together with the main codebase
- Dynamic Library is compiled separately with the main code base, and will be linked to the application at runtime. Dynamic frameworks are more flexible, however they come with some performance overhead as they needed to load at runtime. They will increase the launch time of our app.
