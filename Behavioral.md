# Behavioural

## Can you introduce yourself?

## What is your current role at your current company?

## Can you describe what your typical day looks like?

- First, I check if there is new emails that I haven’t read from yesterday. Take note all the important info that I need to deliver to my team
- Afterwards, I participate in a daily standup meeting where we discuss the progress, the open defects, and our plan of the day. We also briefly discuss if there is a blocking task that need an immediate action, to whom we need to coordinate with, and briefly the way we can tackle the issue to solve it.
- If there is no other meetings in my daily agenda, I start handling my assigned tasks, while I keep an eye on the mailbox, or teams chat for any incidents or blocking issues, or need helps from my colleagues. 

## Tell us a little more about the projects you are working at current company?

- enrollment

## Tell us more about your team?

- 2 iOS developers, 2 Android developers, 1 CJE, and 1 PO.
- at current company, we don’t have tester. Instead, we write unit-test, ui-test to automate the regression testing. Once, we finish a big feature or before submitting the build to AppStore, we set up a meeting called BTF (it means break the feature), or BTA (break the app), in this meeting, we invite developers, POs, CJEs, Managers to join, and test in both Acceptance and Prod environment.
- The acceptable code coverage is 65%. We don’t write unit-test for UI stuffs like (UIView, UIViewController, and so on), we just write unit-test to test the business logic in ViewModel, Coordinator, Services, etc.
- We use `SwiftLint` to check the style and coding convention
- We use `Sonaqube` to check the quality of the code (like code smell, duplication code, code coverage percentage, and so on)
- We use `Checkmarx` is to check the issue regarding the security of a new code
- We also send the build to the PenTest team to check all security issues before merging into the main codebase.

## What motivates you every day?

- I’m curious about the things around me. There is always new things at work that I can learn. It might be the new technology, a new way of writing code, a new way of testing a feature. Of the soft skills that I learn from manager or my colleagues.
- Secondly, I also want to help and share my knowledge with others at work.
- Those things motivate me every day.

## Tell me about the way your team work at current company?

- at current company, we have a platform team who is responsible for infrastructure, setup CI/CD, ensure the quality of the code when merging into the main codebase of the app, and many feature teams. A feature team is responsible to develop a specific number of features of the application. My team is responsible to do the enrolment feature that allows the user to enrol with different means (like using card & card reader, sms/otp, itsme, and so on)
- Our team works with Kanban board that including all steps (like planning, developing, testing, deploying). We have different lanes for iOS team, Android team, and for PO and CJE (customer journey expert who is responsible to do the business analysis). We work in small sprint of 2 weeks to deliver working software.
- We have a sprint planning where the PO will take the task from the backlog, prioritise them, we analyse the business requirements and convert them into the implementable stories with the time or story points estimations
- We have a daily standup meeting where we discuss the progress, the open defects, and the plan of the day. We also briefly discuss if there is a blocking task that need an immediate action, to whom we need to coordinate with, and briefly the way we can tackle the issue to solve it.
- At the end of the sprint, we have a retrospective, where we share the knowledge or difficulty during working in this sprint, and how to improve them.


## Tell me about the challenges at the current job?

## Why do you want to work at Z?

## Why do you want to leave your current job at current company?

- I believe I’ve progressed as far as I can in my current role. I don’t feel like my current role is challenging me anymore. I need a change of environment to motivate me.
- I believe the knowledge I gained during the time I’ve worked at X and Y might be useful here at Z.
